    "The binomial distribution is used when there are two outcomes of a trial (success and failure). It is used to obtain the probability of observing x successes in N trials, with the probability of success on a single trial denoted by p. The binomial distribution assumes that p is fixed for all trials. In other words, it is useful for computing the probability of meeting a particular threshold given a specific error rate, and thus has applications to risk management. For this reason, the binomial distribution is also important in determining statistical significance.\n",

    "The most important part of this question is to realize that the answer is NOT 0.02! This may seem obvious right now, but it is a common mistake, since it is easy to associate the 50-year return period (that is, 1 / 0.02 = 50) to mean that the flood happens once in 50 years. Actually, the probability of exceeding the annual maximum flood level in one year is defined as 0.02, which is one of the parameters to use in our Binomial distribution, $p =  0.02$.\n",
