Welcome to the **Total Probability Theorem module**.

This module is set up with a 3-unit format:
1. The basic theory of a specific concept.
2. Example of how a specific concept is applied to a Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG) problem.
3. Exercises to practice using the method from unit 2.
