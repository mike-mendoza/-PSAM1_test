# # 1.2 Mutually exclusive events
# 
# These characteristics tell us very important information about how we are quantifying the probability of each event we want to consider in our sample space. In this case, whether or not a natural disaster occurs.
# 
# Two events are mutually exclusive when the occurrence of one event excludes the occurrence of another. This means that none of the points included in the event $A$ is included in the event $B$, and the other way around.

# 
# Do you notice anything else interesting about this figure, especially regarding the probability of \(A\) and \(B\) and characteristics about these two events within the bigger picture (i.e., the sample space)?
