    "The fields of tulips located in a coastal area receive water from both ground water (an aquifer) and surface water (a river with a storage device). The operation of this supply system is influenced by the regional droughts which occur randomly with an annual frequency of 15%. There is a 60% chance that extremely low flows will occur in the river during a regional drought. During a year with extremely low flows due to a regional drought, there is a 40% chance to have a failure in the system due to the lack of water in either of the sources. Also, there is a 20% chance that the aquifer is polluted due to brackish water in a year with extremely low flows and there is a 10% chance to have a failure in the system during a dry year when low flows do not occur due to the lack of stored water. \n",
