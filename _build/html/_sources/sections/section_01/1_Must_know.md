Welcome to the **Must-know probability concepts module**, which covers key concepts from probability theory needed to go further in your probability journey in CEG applications. This module is different than the others in this course since it lists many small concepts rather than focuses on one. This is because many of them should have been covered in a high school and bachelor-level course on statistics. Since there are many excellent textbooks and videos on the subject you should refer elsewhere if these concepts are completely unclear to you.
